Psychologist with specialties in [psychoanalysis](https://petercarnochan.com/psychoanalysis/) and [child therapy](https://petercarnochan.com/child-therapy/).

I'm a compassionate, clear thinking psychologist practicing in San Francisco. For the last thirty years, I've worked with children and adults to help them unknot problematic feelings and develop more resilient and expansive modes of living.

In addition to private practice, I teach psychoanalytic theory and clinical technique at a number of schools and clinics.
