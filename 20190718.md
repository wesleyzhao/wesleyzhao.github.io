Ben came at the end of spring. Even though it might rain a little more than in other places, there’s still sunshine in Seattle summers. So he always had his Ray Bans on when he drove. Old reliable. It’s not what he calls it, and not what I called it either, but it’s a good description of the off-white (gray?) Honda suv he drove. One of the first nights he got here, as he was following my car back to my house, he got pulled over because one of his headlights was out. It’s fixed now. With working headlights, sunglasses, and a mix of cd’s, we’re driving.

We drove with west coast mountains and forest as highway backdrop. The music played, and we’d joke and laugh, take photos and videos.  We planned to stop between Seattle and San Francisco to hike the Lost Coast. 25 miles of sand and pacific ocean. We were excited for our big adventure. We didn’t seem sad. And we didn’t talk about her much.

Ben had only been back in Seattle for about 48 hours (he’d left for about a week). And I was feeling like I needed to get away. So a little more than 24 hours before we drove off, I decided I would leave with him. Late at one of the 24-hour grocery stores she used to work from too, we finished our speeches, I bought a one way flight, we slept a few hours, woke up, celebrated and cried, read what we wrote, stayed at her place too late, slept a few more hours, then, far too many hours later than planned, we said bye to the family, and we drove. 

We stopped at several beaches along the way. We didn’t say why, we didn’t need to.

It was a proper road trip. We ate fast food and one-off diners, we loaded up on caffeine and candy at gas stations. The spirit was adventure. And we didn’t talk about her much. We still don’t.

“How are you?” “I’m alright” “I’m glad, me too.” And occasionally, probably only when it’s really too much to bear, often in the middle of the night: “I miss her.” Then the next morning: “I miss her too. You ok?” “Yea, you?” “Yeah, ok, thanks.” Why are we afraid?

After driving through the night to make up for our late start, per classic ‘adventure,’ we arrived at the south end of our Lost Coast with a problem. We only had time to hike one way (my flight left in two nights) and we had neither an extra car nor a shuttle scheduled to hitch us back once we finished. Luckily, after hours of failed hitchhiking, things worked themselves out (as they do on adventures). We got a ride to the north end, and we were on our way.

Besides a special spot on the Ireland Coast, the Lost Coast was Lydia’s favourite. She drove up and down the coast a lot, and would make a stop every time. That’s why we were there. We both knew that. So we didn’t need to talk about it. Ben and I spent that last month, nearly every single day, with each other, and with Lydia too. It had been a week since she died, just over a day since the service, and we drove how she would drive, we made stops like she would stop, and we were hiking like she would hike. We were having an adventure like she would have. But we didn’t talk much about it. Did we need to? Maybe. Sometimes I want to talk about it. I’m not sure I wanted to then. I just wanted to get out. Drive. Hike. Fly. Leave.

But sometimes I remember what café roccoco smelled like, and how the dark polished wooden tables felt. Ben and I would sit there because even though Lydia loved seeing us, and we loved seeing her, she needed to rest a lot. Sometimes I remember exactly how her room looked in the daytime, sometimes in the nighttime, always with walls covered by postcards she strung together and hung off the ceiling, paintings she made and I did my best to staple on straight, and art her friends created for her that filled the spaces in between.

A year later, the room is exactly the same.

Her mom said she doesn’t know why she’d ever have a reason to change it. I spent the anniversary with her parents and a few friends on one of her favorite hikes. We swam in freezing cold glacier water, but beside the comment about her room, that was pretty much anyone said about her.

The last mile of beach we did barefoot, which was nice, but the pavement back to the car was sharp and hot. Ben dropped me off in San Francisco and he continued home to LA. I spent the next three weeks continuing the adrenaline, never really catching a full night of sleep, through Paris, the farm, Shanghai, Japan, Korea. In Japan I spent a few days with Helen, Lydia’s sister, and we didn’t talk about her either. We filled our time with Osaka food halls and Kyoto temples.
