I am currently conducting research for two essays: one on Leavenworth (a small, rapidly changing town two hours east of Seattle) and another on the biology of depression and serotonergic medicines. Previously I published evidence-based mental health resources as a co-founder of [Therapy Notebooks](https://www.therapynotebooks.com), developed a social network for families as a co-founder of [FamilyLeaf](https://techcrunch.com/2013/07/01/origami-labs-acquires-familyleaf-a-competing-private-social-network-for-families/), and wrote software at [Bridgewater](https://www.bridgewater.com/#principles-culture).
